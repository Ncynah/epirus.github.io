# Mobile Experience

Epirus provides a fully responsive user experience. Although primarily intended for use with a desktop computer or laptop, we have designed a great mobile experience too.

When using the mobile experience, all the core functionality of the explorer are avaiable to you. You can access your token, contract, address, transaction and block views. And, for your convenience, the filtering and searching functionalities are also available.

## Navigation

Navigate through the explorer via the menu at the bottom of the screen.

## Contracts

As with the desktop version, your point of entry is the contracts view.

Clicking on a contract takes you to the contract details.

## Filtering and sorting

Sorting and filters are available for all your list views.

This allows you to sort for instance by the most active ERC20 contracts.

## Accounts

You can also view account balances  when you browse to an account which is associated with an Ethereum wallet, i.e. not a smart contract address.
